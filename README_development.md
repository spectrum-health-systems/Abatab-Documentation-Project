# **Stage I**: Monthly development branch

This stage is where the majority of Abatab development takes place.

During monthly development and testing:

* Old monthly development branches are archived, and new monthly development branches are created
* The existing codebase is refactored and cleaned up
* New functionality is added, and existing functionality is updated/modified
* Bugs are squished
* Code is refactored
* New documentation is added, and existing documentation is updated/modified
* Iterative testing is done in a non-production environment

<br>





## Pre-development

Pre-development includes creating a new monthly development branch, and spending a few days refactoring and cleaning up the code and comments. This should be done prior to staring the development of new features, so the entire code base can be tested.

```

### Archive the previous monthly development branch

If the previous monthly development branch was not released, the branch name should remain `MM.DD-development`

If the previous monthly development branch was released, the branch name should be reanemd to `MM.DD-release`

### Create a new monthly development branch

Create a new repository branch named `MM.DD-development` from the previous monthly development branch.

### Refactor

Refactor any code that has been tagged as `// REFACTOR`

### Clean-up

Clean-up code and comments.

## Development

Development includes:

* Adding/enhancing features
* Adding/modifying documentation
* Bug fixes
* Etc.

During development, iterative testing should be done using a non-production environment.

## Timeline breakdown



On the first day of a new month, a new monthly development branch is created from the previous monthly development branch.





Abatab development takes place in the following repositories:

* `MM.DD-development`  
These are the monthly development



<br>














The current development version branch of Abatab is `v23.6`.

## Things to keep in mind about development version branches

Abatab development version branches:

* May be broken!
* May have missing functionality!
* Will have lots of ugly, gross code!
* Will have extensive comments!
* Might be dangerous to use!

<br>



<br>

## Development Version Branch

The majority of development is done in the **development version branch**, including additions and updates to documentation.

The development version branch name is the version being developed (e.g., `23.5d`). Please note the `d` postfix, which indicates that this branch is for development.

The version branch is not deployed to the web service host.



## Development branch

Once the version branch is stable, it is merged with the **Development Branch**.

This is the branch that is deployed to the web service host, and used for testing.

## Main branch

When testing functionality in the development branch is complete, it is merged with the **Main Branch**.

This is the official current development release of Abatab.

### Release types

When a version of Abatab is completed and released, the branch is renamed to `YY.MMx`, where `x` is:

* `d` for development branches that may not be fully functional
* `f` for final branches that have been tested and are fully functional
* stable
* rc
* cr
* hf
