The version branch is not deployed to the web service host.

### Release types

When a version of Abatab is completed and released, the branch is renamed to `YY.MMx`, where `x` is:

* `d` for development branches that may not be fully functional
* `f` for final branches that have been tested and are fully functional

## Development branch

Once the version branch is stable, it is merged with the **Development Branch**.

This is the branch that is deployed to the web service host, and used for testing.
