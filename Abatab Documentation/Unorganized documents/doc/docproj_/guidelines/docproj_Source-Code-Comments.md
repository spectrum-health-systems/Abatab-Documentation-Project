## Source code comments

### Development comments

`\\ Development comments start with double back-slashes`

Development comments contain important information that should not be removed from the source code.

Development comments may contain the following prefixes:

- `\\ DEPRECIATED indicates that the code has been depreciated, but not yet removed`

- `\\ REVIEW indicates that the code should be reviewed and/or refactored`

- `\\ TODO indicates that there is something to be done.`

### Narrative comments

`/* Narrative comments are enclosed with /* */, and provide provide additional information/narrative about a block of code
  */`

Narrative comments can be removed from the source code (but why?).

Narrative comments may contain the following prefixes:

```csharp
/* DEVNOTE
 * Occasionally there will be detailed development information about something.
*/
```
